Am Ende ne interaktive Part machen, mit wie hätten das andere Menschen gelöst?


In the abstract I promised I'll be talking about python. But really this talk is more about linguistics.
I'm going to tell you about a project I started approx. 3 years ago.

Well, knowing how to code is definitely a huge advantage when trying to tackle linguistics data.
So the talk is a bit about coding and python as well^^.

Finished CS bachelor; wasn't sure it's the thing for me; started a Spanish degree because I was fascinated by linguistics but too lazy to enroll in a proper linguistics degree; both fields have a lot more in common than you'll asume at 1st glance.
